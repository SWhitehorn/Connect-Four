# ConnectFour

Command-line Connect Four game in Java, featuring an implementation of a AI player using a minimax algorithm. 

Project started as coursework, but was developed further (in particular, adding an intelligent AI player) as an extra project to explore algorithm implementation and decision-making. Due to a coursework requisite, the code is extensively commented. I have left this on there to provide an explanation of the code.
